# Is List Panlidrome

**Note:** Try to solve this task in O(n) time using O(1) additional space, where n is the number of elements in l, since this is what you'll be asked to do during an interview.

Given a singly linked list of integers, determine whether or not it's a palindrome.

#### Example

For `l = [0, 1, 0]`, the output should be
`isListPalindrome(l) = true`

For `l = [1, 2, 2, 3]`, the output should be
`isListPalindrome(l) = false`.

#### Input/Output
* *Execution time limit:* 4 seconds (py3)
* *Input:* `linkedlist.integer l`, A singly linked list of integers.
* *Guaranteed constraints:*
  * 0 ≤ `list.size` ≤ 5 · 105,
  * -109 ≤ element value ≤ 109.
* *Output:* `boolean`, Return `true` if l is a palindrome, otherwise return `false`.
